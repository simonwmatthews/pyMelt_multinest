## Iterative olivine addition algorithm
This folder includes files for performing iterative olivine addition for projection from low Fo to high Fo as demonstrated in Matthews et al. (2021) and Wong et al. (2022).

This folder comprises two files:
* OlivineProjectionIterator.pynb: jupyter notebook demo for the olivine addition algorithm.
* olivine_Fo_iterator.py: py file with key functions used in olivine addition algorithm.
